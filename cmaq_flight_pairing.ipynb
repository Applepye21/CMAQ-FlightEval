    "# CMAQ Flight Pairing\n",
    "\n",

    "    author: Michael J. Pye (pye.michael@epa.gov)\n",
    "    date created: 2025-01-13\n",

    "\n",
    "### Origin\n",
    "This notebook is based upon another notebook written by Havala Pye (pye.havala@epa.gov) for the Firex field campaign created on 2023-01-10.  \n",
    "The path to the original notebook is: /work/MOD3DEV/has/2022firex/postproc/notebooks/2024_firexpairv3_hotp_20240304_base3.ipynb  \n",
    "Although this notebook has a very different structure, at least some of the ideas for this notebook came from that notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "This notebook is designed to perform flight pairing tasks for any flight field campaign to CMAQ conc files. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Log\n",
    "* 01/13/2025 - Created notebook and organized introduction section\n",
    "* 01/14/2025 - Began the `pair_flight()` functon\n",
    "    * Added a section to find the model domiain grid files\n",
    "    * Added a section to find the row and col of a grid point associated with a flight lat and lon\n",
    "* 01/15/2025 - added another section to `pair_flight()` that finds the file associated with a given observation as well as the timestep within that file\n",
    "* 01/17/2025 - Fixed the longitude distance issue in the section of the pairing function that finds the longitude distance from every grid point to the aircraft. Solved the issue by multiplying the distances by the cosine of the latitude \n",
    "* 01/21/2025 - added section to save index information to NetCDF\n",
    "* 01/23/2025 - Changed method of horizontal matching to calculate the great circle distance and then find the minimum distance\n",
    "* 01/24/2025 - Added function to extract CMAQ data based on aircraft location within 3D CMAQ grid\n",
    "* 01/24/2025 - Added `source` attribute to NetCDF file storing lat-lon data and assigned it to a string that provides information about where the simulation domain files are stored. This is so the CMAQ data extraction function knows where to look in the case the user wants to include coordinate data in the CMAQ output DataFrame.\n",
    "* 01/28/2025 - Added a function to combine the pairing and extraction processes together, allowing the user to avoid saving a NetCDF containing index information if that is not desireable.\n",
    "* 02/03/2025 - Updated the extraction function to allow extraction of paired data from METCRO3D and GRIDCRO3D files\n",
    "* 02/05/2025 - Updated the lat-lon pairing algorithm to include the arccosine function to make the process more clear.\n",
    "* 02/06/2025 - Gave the pairing function the ability to determine if the aircraft is outside the model domain. Set indices to missing values in this case and then extracted values as missing when encountering missing indices.\n",
    "* 02/13/2025 - updated the pairing function file time string to be created based on `datateime.datetime.strftime()` method instead of hardcoding the format. This allows for a future update where the file time string format can vary. This also made the `pad_zeros()` function useless, so it was deleted along with the rest of the general functions section.\n",
    "* 2/14/2025 - Added a function to print out the flight ID's within a given index NetCDF file. \n",

    "# Pair flight data to CMAQ\n",
    "The purpose of the `pair_flight()` function is to find the CMAQ output file grid points associated with with a flight trajectory and save the indices of each timestep for the flight to a variable in a NetCDF file.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Parameters:  \n",
    "* `flight_id` (str) - Acts as an identifier for the flight being submitted. Will be used as the NetCDF variable name\n",
    "* `flight_lons` (list) - Provides the longitude of the aircraft at every observation\n",
    "* `flight_lats` (list) - Provides the latitude of the aircraft at every obersvation\n",
    "* `flight_alts` (list) - Provides the altitude of the plane at every observation in meters above ground level\n",
    "* `flight_times` (list) - Provides the time each observation was taken. Required format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n",
    "* `index_file_path` (str) - Path of the NetCDF file you would like to save the CMAQ indices to, regardless of whether the file at the entered path exists yet.\n",
    "* `domain_dir` (str) - The name of the directory where the GRIDCRO2D and METCRO3D are stored.\n",
    "* `model_resolution` (int) [Default: `12000`] - The horizontal grid spacing of the model in units of meters. This is only used to tell the function if the aircraft has left the model domain. Set this value to limit the farthest distance from a model grid point that you would like flight data to pair to model data. \n",
    "* `alt_type` (str) [Default: `'ASL'`] - specifies whether the altitudes passed to the function are in height above ground level or height above sea level. the options are `'ASL'` (above sea level) and `'AGL'` (above ground level) \n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* Make sure to remove any data with a missing longitude, latitude, altitude, OR time. Failure to do so will result in differences in the number of values from the model output and from the aircraft observations.\n",
    "* In the function, there is a section that finds the closest point in the model to the aircraft in the horizontal using the grid point's and the aircraft's lat-lon coordinates. At the top of the section, there is a comment that says: \"Find the x and y indices of the closest grid point to the aircraft by calculating the distance to all points.\" The algorithm used in this section is based on a formula for calulating the distance between two points on Earth based on Lat-Lon coordinates. Normally, you would multiply the `angle` variable by Earth's radius to calculate a distance. However, whichever grid point has the smallest angle between itself and the aircraft must have the shortest distance from the plane. Therefore, finding the index of the point with the smallest angle will give the closest grid point to the aircraft.  Websites that describe that formula are listed here:\n",
    "    * https://dtcenter.org/sites/default/files/community-code/met/docs/write-ups/gc_simple.pdf\n",
    "    * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/great-circle-distance-formula/\n",
    "    * https://www.themathdoctors.org/distances-on-earth-1-the-cosine-formula/  \n",
    "* For times where the aircraft is farther than the set value of the model_resolution parameter in meters from the closest model grid point, `-99999999` is assigned as the index value for the time, layer, row, and column.  "

Therefore, the object passed to this parameter will not have an impact on the resulting DataFrame.\n",

Potential options are `'CONC'`, `'CONC_3D'`, `'METCRO3D'`, and `'GRIDCRO3D'` among others. The 3D grid of the file must be based on the grid box centers as opposed to the corners. For example: `'METCRO3D'` works, but not `'METDOT3D'`.\n",
    "* `output_vars` (list or NoneType) [Default: `None`] - List of variables from the CMAQ output file that you would like to extract. If None is passed, data from all 3D variables will be extracted.\n",
    "* `output_alt_type` (str) [Default: `'ASL'`] - specifies whether the altitudes passed to the function are in height above ground level or height above sea level. the options are `'ASL'` (above sea level) and `'AGL'` (above ground level). \n",
    "* `list_vars` (bool) [Default: `False`] - When set to `True`, this will tell the function to print a list of the variables within the selected CMAQ output file type. Setting this parameter to True will raise a `KeyError` and force the program to end. When set to `False`, no variable list will be printed and the funxtion will not force a `KeyError`\n",
