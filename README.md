# CMAQ-FlightEval
This repository contains a tool for matching CMAQ forecasts to atmospheric observations from aircraft. The tool is primarily built to work with data from the AEROMMA field campaign but can be adapted to work with data from other sets of aircraft data. To learn how to use the tool, see the [tutorial](cmaq_flight_matching_tutorial.ipynb).
